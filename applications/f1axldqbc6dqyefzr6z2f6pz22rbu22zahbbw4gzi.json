    "Brief history of your project and organization": "We are a well-known AI company for healthcare. Our goal is to empower individuals to proactively monitor their health and detect potential problems early - no matter where they are or what their economic situation is. We are committed to changing the way people participate in traditional health screenings, ultimately improving health and reducing the resource burden on hospitals. We need a lot of medical-related data in our research, and because the storage cost is relatively expensive, we choose IPFS, hoping to use miners to store some of the data we need.",
    "Is this project associated with other projects/ecosystem stakeholders?": "No",
    "Describe the data being stored onto Filecoin": "Ten tasks from the Medical Segmentation Decathlon Challenge. Tasks are organized by organ system and pathology, as follow, Liver Tumours; Brain Tumours; Hippocampus; Lung Tumours; Prostate; Cardiac; Pancreas Tumour; Colon Cancer; Hepatic Vasculature; Spleen. Tasks are provided in both tar.gz and uncompressed format.",
    "Where was the data currently stored in this dataset sourced from": "AWS Cloud",
    "How do you plan to prepare the dataset": "1. We are currently downloading the source dataset on AWS\n2. Encapsulate data into a car file through boost\n3. Communicate with SP to determine whether to send data offline or online\n4.Send deals to SPs\n5.SPs store data\n6. Keep data retrieval available",
    "Please share a sample of the data (a link to a file, an image, a table, etc., are good ways to do this.)": "s3://msd-for-monai/\ns3://msd-for-monai-eu/",
    "Confirm that this is a public dataset that can be retrieved by anyone on the network (i.e., no specific permissions or access rights are required to view the data)": "[x] I confirm",
    "What is the expected retrieval frequency for this data": "Weekly",
    "For how long do you plan to keep this dataset stored on Filecoin": "1 to 1.5 years",
    "In which geographies do you plan on making storage deals": "Greater China, Asia other than Greater China, North America",
    "How will you be distributing your data to storage providers": "HTTP or FTP server, IPFS",
    "Please list the provider IDs and location of the storage providers you will be working with. Note that it is a requirement to list a minimum of 5 unique provider IDs, and that your client address will be verified against this list in the future": "f03251999 Hong Kong\nf03515608 Hong Kong\nf03228500 USA\nf02827109 China\nf02826602 China",
    "Can you confirm that you will follow the Fil+ guideline (Data owner should engage at least 4 SPs and no single SP ID should receive >30% of a client's allocated DataCap)": "Yes"
