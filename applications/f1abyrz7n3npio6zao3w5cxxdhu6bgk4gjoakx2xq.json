    "Brief history of your project and organization": "Youtoo Robot was founded by a team from top universities, including The Chinese University of Hong Kong, and is dedicated to advancing the application of robotics in manufacturing. The company’s main product is the Youtoo Robot application software, which uses algorithms and AI technology to break down the technical barriers of robotic applications, enabling novice users without a robotics background to easily complete the full lifecycle deployment tasks of robots.",
    "Is this project associated with other projects/ecosystem stakeholders?": "No",
    "Describe the data being stored onto Filecoin": "1.Robot Software and Application Data: The source code, application files, and updates for the Youtoo Robot application could be stored on Filecoin. This would ensure a decentralized, tamper-resistant archive of software versions and releases.\n\n2.AI and Algorithm Models: The AI models and algorithms used to power the robot’s decision-making and operations could be stored securely on Filecoin, ensuring easy access and versioning across a distributed network.\n\t\n3.Training Data: Large datasets used for training machine learning models in robotics, such as sensor data, environmental data, and robot interaction data, could be stored on Filecoin. This would help preserve the integrity of the data while allowing for efficient retrieval and analysis.\n\t\n4.Logs and Sensor Data: As robots interact with their environments, they generate sensor data and logs. Storing this data on Filecoin ensures that it is securely backed up and can be accessed for future analysis, troubleshooting, or compliance purposes.\n\t\n5.Documentation and Manuals: The technical documentation, user manuals, and system configuration files for the robots could be stored on Filecoin, making them easily accessible to both internal teams and external customers in a secure, decentralized manner.\n\t\n6.Collaboration and Research Data: If Youtoo Robot collaborates with other institutions or researchers, Filecoin could be used to store research papers, experimental results, and other data shared in the course of development.",
    "Where was the data currently stored in this dataset sourced from": "My Own Storage Infra",
    "How do you plan to prepare the dataset": "1.Data Collection and Aggregation\n•Objective: Collect all relevant data, including sensor data, AI models, training datasets, application files, logs, and documentation.\n•Tools Used:\n•API: Use REST API or gRPC interfaces to collect data from the robot systems and software, depending on the system architecture.\n\t\n2.Data Structuring and Formatting\n•Objective: Organize the data into structured formats (e.g., JSON, CSV, Parquet) to facilitate efficient storage and retrieval from Filecoin.\n•Tools Used:\n•JSON: Used for lightweight data formats, such as configuration files or robot settings.\n\t\n3.Data Compression and Encryption\n•Objective: Optimize storage by compressing data and ensure that the data is encrypted before uploading to Filecoin for security purposes.\n•Tools Used:\n•gzip or Zstandard: Used for compressing large datasets to reduce bandwidth and storage requirements.\n\t\n4.Uploading Data to Filecoin\n•Objective: Upload the processed data to the Filecoin network to ensure decentralized and secure storage.\n•Tools Used:\n•Lotus: The official Filecoin client used to interact with the Filecoin network. It allows uploading and retrieving data.\n\t\n5.Data Retrieval and Access\n•Objective: Ensure that data can be efficiently retrieved when needed while maintaining security and access control.\n•Tools Used:\n•Lotus: Used again to retrieve data from the Filecoin network, ensuring that files can be fetched from decentralized storage as needed.",
    "Please share a sample of the data (a link to a file, an image, a table, etc., are good ways to do this.)": "https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MzkxMjQwMTA3Ng==&mid=2247483792&idx=1&sn=5d9f2801b4ae6449c79bf5819cd9afa1&chksm=c10c364bf67bbf5d547940bbe79a1c7710fef7fac837cf56b3c88e43632e2f85da49159dbec6#rd\n\nhttps://sav87di13u.feishu.cn/docx/LnRVdziUiorfaGxBnPkcwBgLnmf",
    "Confirm that this is a public dataset that can be retrieved by anyone on the network (i.e., no specific permissions or access rights are required to view the data)": "[x] I confirm",
    "What is the expected retrieval frequency for this data": "Yearly",
    "For how long do you plan to keep this dataset stored on Filecoin": "1.5 to 2 years",
    "In which geographies do you plan on making storage deals": "Greater China, North America, Asia other than Greater China",
    "How will you be distributing your data to storage providers": "HTTP or FTP server, IPFS, Shipping hard drives",
    "Please list the provider IDs and location of the storage providers you will be working with. Note that it is a requirement to list a minimum of 5 unique provider IDs, and that your client address will be verified against this list in the future": "f03385462 United States\nf03385456 United States\nf03402285 China\nf03402308 China\nf03402347 Singapore\nf03402379 Singapore\nf03321512  KR Seoul Seoul\nf01084941 HK",
    "Can you confirm that you will follow the Fil+ guideline (Data owner should engage at least 4 SPs and no single SP ID should receive >30% of a client's allocated DataCap)": "Yes"
