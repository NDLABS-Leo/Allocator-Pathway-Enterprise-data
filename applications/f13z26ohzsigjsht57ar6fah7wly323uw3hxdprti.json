    "Brief history of your project and organization": "Jixue Team: Bridging Learning Opportunities for the Future\r\n\r\nThe Jixue team is comprised of forward-thinking members, dedicated to building a one-stop course booking platform that represents the future of learning. Recognizing the growing demand for children’s courses and activities from parents and schools, and aware that passionate educators often struggle with enrollment due to time constraints and limited promotion, the Jixue platform aims to bridge this gap.\r\n\r\nWe offer parents and schools a seamless experience for searching, booking, and paying for courses, simplifying their lives and enhancing overall quality of life. Simultaneously, we work closely with educational partners to increase their visibility at no cost, making it easy for them to reach potential students and focus on teaching.\r\n\r\nTo enhance user experience, we continually upgrade our platform’s features, enabling users to find the best-fit courses quickly. With intelligent search functionality and multi-filter options, users can gain first-hand feedback from reviews and ratings, ensuring course quality. The platform also recommends courses based on user preferences and habits and allows users to effortlessly manage bookings through a “comprehensive management system.”\r\n\r\nLearn what you want, whenever you want, with Jixue!\r\nJust a few steps, and you’re ready to enroll!",

    "Where was the data currently stored in this dataset sourced from": "My Own Storage Infra",
    "How do you plan to prepare the dataset": "1.Data Classification and Organization\r\n\r\nFirst, I would classify the data to be stored, distinguishing between essential business data (such as user information, course content, payment details, etc.) and auxiliary data (such as course reviews, non-essential logs, etc.). When storing critical data on Filecoin, I would pay special attention to its accessibility and security, while non-essential data has relatively lower storage requirements.\r\n\r\n2.Data Cleaning and Optimization\r\n\r\nBefore uploading, I would clean and optimize all data, including:\r\n•Removing redundant information to reduce storage space requirements.\r\n•Compressing files to improve upload and storage efficiency.\r\n•Structuring or segmenting data to enhance storage and retrieval efficiency on Filecoin.",
