    "Describe the data being stored onto Filecoin": "The data types we intend to store include the following:\r\n\r\n1.3D Models and Rendering Data: We have a large collection of high-quality 3D models, textures, and rendering data. This includes geometric information, materials, lighting effects, and other details essential for creating realistic visual representations.\r\n\r\n2.Video and Image Assets: Primarily used in XR content production and playback, we rely on high-resolution video and image data. This includes 360-degree videos, panoramic photos, and static augmented reality images that help present detailed and immersive scenes.\r\n\t\r\n3.Audio Data: For AR/VR experiences, we utilize 3D and spatial audio. This includes environmental sound effects, background music, and audio files associated with specific objects to enhance the immersive experience.",
    "Where was the data currently stored in this dataset sourced from": "My Own Storage Infra",
    "How do you plan to prepare the dataset": "We mainly need to convert, pack and slice the files to optimise storage and retrieval efficiency.\r\n1, Firstly, we will adjust the format of 3d models to a smaller format according to the need, in addition, we will encode videos and images in a compatible format.\r\n2、We will mainly use the car format to divide large files into multiple small files.\r\n3、Additionally for data transfer",
