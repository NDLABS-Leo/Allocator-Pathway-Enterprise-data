    "Brief history of your project and organization": "About Us\nUsing clinical assessment, whole genome sequencing, neural encoding, and a combination of traditional, robot- and artificial intelligence-driven intervention, BlueSky Precision Medicine has deployed a clinical practice for early detection and early behavioral intervention of pre-symptomatic children at risk for developing autism spectrum disorder.\n\nThe precision medicine approach allows stratification of pre-symptomatic children who are at elevated risks of developing autism spectrum disorder to receive behavioral intervention leading to improved outcomes.\n\nOur clinical services are currently available in Hong Kong. To find out if our clinical assessment and diagnostic testing may be right for your child, please contact us.",
