    "Brief history of your project and organization": "Our team is a very pure development team, more than half of whom have more than 5 years of development experience in communication, Internet, blockchain and other industries. We hope that we can gain users' recognition by exporting useful tools and platforms.",
    "Is this project associated with other projects/ecosystem stakeholders?": "No",
    "Describe the data being stored onto Filecoin": "The Cell Painting Gallery is a collection of image datasets created using the Cell Painting assay. The images of cells are captured by microscopy imaging, and reveal the response of various labeled cell components to whatever treatments are tested, which can include genetic perturbations, chemicals or drugs, or different cell types. The datasets can be used for diverse applications in basic biology and pharmaceutical research, such as identifying disease-associated phenotypes, understanding disease mechanisms, and predicting a drug’s activity, toxicity, or mechanism of action (Chandrasekaran et al 2020). This collection is maintained by the Carpenter–Singh lab and the Cimini lab at the Broad Institute. A human-friendly listing of datasets, instructions for accessing them, and other documentation is at the corresponding GitHub page about the Gallery.",
    "Where was the data currently stored in this dataset sourced from": "AWS Cloud",
    "How do you plan to prepare the dataset": "No response",
    "Please share a sample of the data (a link to a file, an image, a table, etc., are good ways to do this.)": "Disclaimer: \r\nDue to un-answered issues around whether combined requests or duplicate requests can be used to apply LDN. This is a series of recent new open datasets never applied by anybody (aka calling dibs).\r\n\r\nDescription: \r\nThe Cell Painting Gallery is a collection of image datasets created using the Cell Painting assay.

    "Confirm that this is a public dataset that can be retrieved by anyone on the network (i.e., no specific permissions or access rights are required to view the data)": "[X] I confirm",
    "What is the expected retrieval frequency for this data": "Monthly",
    "For how long do you plan to keep this dataset stored on Filecoin": "1.5 to 2 years",
    "In which geographies do you plan on making storage deals": "Greater China, Asia other than Greater China, North America, Europe",
    "How will you be distributing your data to storage providers": "Cloud storage (i.e. S3), Shipping hard drives, Lotus built-in data transfer",
    "Please list the provider IDs and location of the storage providers you will be working with. Note that it is a requirement to list a minimum of 5 unique provider IDs, and that your client address will be verified against this list in the future": "f03151449, Shenzhen, China           \r\nf03151456, Shenzhen, China               \r\nf03179570, Singapore       \r\nf03179555, Singapore           \r\nf03178077, Tokyo, Japan   \r\nf03178144, Tokyo, Japan   \r\nf03179572, US \r\nf03214937, US \r\nf03229932, South Korea\r\nf03229933, South Korea",
    "Can you confirm that you will follow the Fil+ guideline (Data owner should engage at least 4 SPs and no single SP ID should receive >30% of a client's allocated DataCap)": "Yes"
